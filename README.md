# AmongJS
among us coded to run entirely inside a terminal through node.js
We have a custom terminal that is packaged with the game itself, the game will run best inside it as the terminal has custom styling to allow color to work a bit better.
The game is entirely functional outside of our terminal, although colors may be slightly off.
COLOR BLIND MODE EXISTS, launch the game with the launch argument "-ClrBlindMode"
Launch args below:
client args
-ClrBlindMode   :  launches the game into color blind mode, instead of rendering the player characters the game will render them as unique ascii symbols
-QuickStart     :  skip all flavor text and unnecessary dialog (except the epilepsy warning, if you would like to skip that use "-SkipAll" instead) when joining a game HIGHLY RECOMMEND after first few launches or if in dev
-SkipAll        :  this does the same thing as quick start but it also skips all warnings, by using this launch argument you are stating that you have read all warnings and are launching the game anyways
