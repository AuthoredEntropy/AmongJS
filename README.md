# AmongJS
among us coded to run entirely inside a terminal through node.js
We have a custom terminal that is packaged with the game itself, the game will run best inside it as the terminal has custom styling to allow color to work a bit better.
The game is entirely functional outside of our terminal, although colors may be slightly off.
COLOR BLIND MODE EXISTS, launch the game with the launch argument "-ClrBlindMode"
Launch args below:
client args
-ClrBlindMode   :  launches the game into color blind mode, instead of rendering the player characters the game will render them as unique ascii symbols
-QuickStart     :  skip all flavor text and unnecessary dialog when joining a game HIGHLY RECOMMEND after first few launches or if in dev
