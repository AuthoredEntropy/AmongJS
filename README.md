# AmongJS
among us coded to run entirely inside a terminal through node.js
We have a custom terminal that is packaged with the game itself, the game will run best inside it as the terminal has custom styling to allow color to work a bit better.
The game is entirely functional outside of our terminal, although colors may be slightly off.
COLOR BLIND MODE EXISITS, launch the game with the launch argument "-ClrBlindMode"
